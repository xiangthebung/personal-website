/**
 * Adaptive tone mapping maths.
 *
 * The curve is a three-stage transfer function evaluated per channel:
 *
 *   1. exposure       v = x * exposure            (scene-dependent dimming)
 *   2. shadow opening v = v^(1/gamma) then a small black-point lift
 *   3. highlight knee v > k  ->  k + a*(1 - e^-((v-k)/a))
 *
 * Stage 3 is C1-continuous at the knee (slope exactly 1 there) and its slope
 * decreases monotonically afterwards, so mid-tone contrast survives while
 * highlights roll off instead of clipping. `a` is solved so that full-scale
 * input lands exactly on the requested white point.
 *
 * The adaptation is scene-gated: dark scenes engage the shadow lift, bright
 * scenes engage the exposure dim and the highlight shoulder, and a normally
 * exposed scene engages *neither* — the curve converges on the identity and
 * the video passes through untouched. The corrections are for the extremes;
 * applying them to content that needs none is what washes an image out.
 *
 * On top of those three stages sits a fourth thing that is not a stage at all:
 * a **white-point ceiling** (`whitePointCeiling`), a standing cap on the curve's
 * output that is armed while the viewer is dark-adapted. Everything above is
 * reactive, and reaction is the wrong shape for a cut — the bright frame reaches
 * the screen before anything has measured it. The ceiling is the only part of
 * this module that is already correct on a frame it has never seen, which is
 * what bounds the transient a night scene cutting to daylight puts on the
 * screen. See `whitePointCeiling` for why it does not wash out normal content.
 *
 * Two things make the result read as "dimmer" rather than "flatter":
 *
 *  - **The drive signal is linear light.** `mean` averages gamma-encoded luma,
 *    which is a measure of how dark a frame *looks*, dominated by however much
 *    of the frame is dark. A dashcam shot is half black dashboard and half
 *    overcast sky: its encoded mean says "normal", while the sky is throwing
 *    real light at the viewer. `light` averages in linear light and answers the
 *    question that actually matters — how much light is coming off the screen —
 *    so the exposure servo and the shadow-lift veto both run off it.
 *
 *  - **Slope is allocated by content.** A curve that dims must lose slope
 *    somewhere; the only question is where. A fixed shoulder always spends it
 *    at the top of the range, which on a bright scene is exactly where the
 *    pixels are densest. Given the frame histogram, `buildToneCurve` instead
 *    redistributes slope towards the levels the scene actually occupies and
 *    away from the empty ones, in proportion to how much range the dimming took
 *    away. Without a histogram it falls back to the plain parametric curve.
 *
 * Everything in this module is pure so it can be unit tested without a DOM,
 * and so the render loop can cheaply diff the produced curve.

/**
 * Analyse a frame: re-aim the targets, then advance by `dt` like any other
 * frame.
 *
 * Asymmetric time constants are the core of the comfort behaviour: dimming
 * happens quickly (a scene got bright, protect the viewer) while recovery is
 * slow (avoid visible breathing). A separate fast-acting flash guard handles
 * single-sample luminance jumps such as cuts to white or camera flashes.
 *
 * Those time constants are the right answer for *continuous* footage and the
 * wrong one at a cut. Easing exists to hide a correction inside content that is
 * already moving; at a cut there is nothing to hide it in, and nothing that
 * needs hiding either, because the cut itself masks any change made on the same
 * frame. Easing is actively worse there: the new scene arrives, the curve does
 * not, and the picture visibly drifts for up to `recoverTau` afterwards.
 *
 * So the state is eased and snapped in the same expression. `cut` (0..1) blends
 * between the eased value and the target and reaches 1 once the frame's
 * luminance distribution has moved far enough, fast enough, to be a scene change
 * rather than motion — see {@link sceneShift}. The first analysed frame is a
 * full cut by definition, which is where the old first-frame special case went.
 *
 * Two clocks, because a caller that skips frames has two different intervals
 * and the rate tests want the other one. `dt` is this frame's share of the
 * integration, matching what {@link advanceAdaptState} was handed on every
 * frame in between. `sinceMeasure` is how long ago the frame these statistics
 * are being compared against was taken, which is what `jump` and `shift` were
 * accumulated over — dividing those by one frame instead would read a stride of
 * 4 as a scene changing four times as fast as it is, and fire the flash guard
 * on ordinary motion. They are equal, and both default to `dt`, whenever the
 * caller analyses every frame it advances.

 * offending frame is on screen before anything has measured it. Detection costs
 * at least a frame, more when `frameStride` has backed off, and a cut that only
 * partly registers as one gets only partial snap credit — so the reactive path
 * has no worst-case bound at all. Measured at the default strength, a dark
 * scene sat at a white point of 0.91 while the bright scene it cut to settled at
 * 0.67: the gap between those two numbers, for as long as detection took, *was*
 * the flash.
 *
 * The ceiling closes that gap by being armed before the cut instead of after
 * it. It is not a reaction to the bright frame; it is a standing limit that the
 * bright frame runs into. That makes the peak output across a cut monotonically
 * non-increasing regardless of whether the cut was detected, how much snap
 * credit it earned, or how many frames the engine skipped.
 *
 * It stays out of the way of the identity-on-normal-content rule, because it is
 * gated on `darkAdapt`: a normally exposed scene arms it not at all and gets an
 * unmodified curve. A dark scene arms it fully, which costs that scene almost
 * nothing — a night frame has very few pixels above `kneeStart`, and the ones it
