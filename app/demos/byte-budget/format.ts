/*
 * COPIED, NOT WRITTEN.
 *
 * Everything below this comment is byte-identical to `src/core/format.ts` in the Byte
 * Budget extension (github.com/xiangthebung/byte-budget). This header is the only thing
 * added; nothing in the file has been edited, and nothing in it should be. If the
 * extension's formatting changes, re-copy the file rather than patching this one.
 *
 * It is here because the scene beside it is made almost entirely of numbers, and a
 * number is only evidence if it was produced the way the product produces it. Rounding a
 * byte count is not the trivial function it looks like: the unit is chosen by which one
 * the figure fills, the decimal is dropped above three digits because "1247 MB" is
 * harder to read at a glance than "1.2 GB", the toolbar badge is capped at four
 * characters because Chrome truncates a longer one to something unreadable, and a
 * percentage prints ">99%" rather than "100%" so a rounded figure never reads as a
 * certainty. Re-typing any of that from memory produces figures that look right and are
 * not the product's.
 *
 * `types.ts` beside this file supplies the one type this imports, and explains why that
 * is a shim rather than a second copy.
 */

/**
 * Display formatting for byte counts.
 *
 * Both unit systems are offered because both audiences are right: a network bill
 * is quoted in decimal gigabytes, and a file on disk is measured in binary ones.
 * Guessing which the reader meant is how a tracker ends up 7% out and blamed for
 * it, so the choice is a setting and the unit is always printed.
 *
 * Formatting and `parseByteSize` are one design, not two functions that happen to
 * live together: the app has to be able to read back what it printed. Change the
 * separator handling on either side alone and a person whose locale writes "1,5 GB"
 * either sees a figure this file cannot parse, or types one it reads as 15 GB.

 *
 * - a lone comma with one or two digits behind it is a decimal point: `1,5`;
 * - a comma in strict three-digit groups is a thousands separator: `1,500`;
 * - a dot is a decimal point unless there is more than one, which only grouping can
 *   explain: `1.5`, `1.234.567`;
 * - with both present, the last one is the decimal point and the other has to be
 *   grouping: `1,234.5`, `1.234,5`;
 * - anything else is `null`.
 *
 * A lone separator with exactly three digits behind it (`1,234`, `1.234`) is legal
 * both ways somewhere, and the rules above settle each on the en-US reading of that
 * character. That tie-break cannot corrupt a round trip — `splitBytes` never groups
 * and never writes more than one decimal, so neither form is something this
